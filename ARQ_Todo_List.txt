This document is meant to serve as a list of what is to be prioritized in order to accomplish 'The Arquebus' goals.

Currently, 'The Arquebus' is on version 'v1.7a - Sizzle' which was published on the github on '03/05/2021 @08:00PM EST'.
The next 'major' version is version 'v2.0 - Bang'.

If an item has been accomplished it'll usually be marked 'done' at the end of its task in parentheses. If it hasn't been completed yet then the status will be indicated in parentheses instead.

If an item is tied to another task it will be marked as such in brackets. For example, Medium Priority tasks 1-3 are children of High Priority 3 so they are marked with a [HP3] prefix.

If one or more 'High priority' tasks have been accomplished it will require a 'major' version (essentially 1.0, 2.0, etc.) iteration on the github. 'Medium priority' tasks will require a 'minor' version (0.1, 0.2, etc.) iteration on the github. 'Low priority' tasks can be grouped together for a 'patch' iteration (1.1a, 1.1b, etc.) on the github by item.

Always sign off on when uploading to the github!
