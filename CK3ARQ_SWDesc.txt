[h1]Overview[/h1]
Adds the [b]Arquebus[/b] to the game as a late medieval era innovation [b][i][u]acquirable by all cultures[/u][/i][/b]. Once unlocked you can then recruit the [b]Arquebusier[/b] MaA regiment for a reasonable cost.

The downside to this awesome firepower? It's locked behind a set date for semi-historical accuracy. You can find it under [i][u]Cultural and Regional[/u][/i] innovations.

The unit stats are adequately buffed for a ranged unit so if any changes are necessary they'll be made, for the sake of balance.

[b][i](Ignore the 'Not available' message, just means it isn't unlocked yet!)[/i][/b]

[h1]Planned Additions[/h1]
Currently, the mod is functioning in what can be considered a [i]final[/i] state (barring any patch/balance fixes). However, there are definitely future plans in mind!
[list]
[*]Add a chain of events which leads up to the acquisition of gunpowder.
[*]Flavorful events that improve the abilities of your Arquebusiers.
[*]More localization for different languages.
[/list]
There's no set date on when these things will be introduced but I do hope to get these extras added in eventually!

[h1]Mod Compatibility[/h1]
There shouldn't be any conflicts with any mods not listed below, as the files are all unique.
 
[h3]Possible Conflicts[/h3]
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2238122607]Dieu et Mon Droit[/url] - There may be minor compatibility issues with DMD as it weighs MAA regiments using it's own unique balance system. [i](You may not see the same system applied to the Arquebusier if used together)[/i]
[/list]

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*]With running saves the innovation may not appear properly on the Cultural Innovations screen. (Please see [b]Troubleshooting[/b] for a possible fix)
[/list]

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[b]**YOU MAY NEED TO START A NEW SAVE**[/b]
In order for this innovation to appear properly you might need to start a new save, blame PDX for not making them seamlessly integrate. Sorry folks!!

[b]**POSSIBLE WORKAROUND**[/b]
A quick workaround to solve this issue, with running saves, is to open your game with the [b]debug_mode[/b] option enabled in the launcher and unlock the innovation via console with this command:
[b]"discover_innovation innovation_arquebus"[/b]

This will unlock the ability to recruit the MAA regiment for the Arquebusier. The only drawback to doing this is you don't get the artificial time-lock if you force unlock it before the intended year.
