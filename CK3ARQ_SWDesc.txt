[h1]Mod Overview[/h1]
Adds the [b]Arquebus[/b] to the game as a late medieval era innovation [b][i][u]acquirable by all cultures[/u][/i][/b]. Once unlocked you can then recruit the [b]Arquebusier[/b] MaA regiment, or associated cultural regiments, for a reasonable cost.

The downside to this awesome firepower? It's locked behind a set date for semi-historical accuracy. You can find it under [i][u]Cultural and Regional[/u][/i] innovations.

The unit stats are adequately buffed for a ranged unit so if any changes are necessary they'll be made, for the sake of balance.

[h3]Current Features[/h3]
Although small, this mod packs a mighty punch in the way of flavor for your game. The fluff provided isn't extensive but it is, hopefully, a welcome addition.
[list]
[*][b]Gunpowder?![/b] In the Middle Ages?! Not to worry, this powerful innovation cannot be unlocked until [b]1375[/b]!
[*]Unique MaA regiment, the [b]Arquebusier[/b], a strong ranged unit wielding the power of gunpowder!
[*]Unique Cultural MaA regiments! Wield the power of the [b]Janissaries[/b] or master the powerful [b]Spanish Tercios[/b]! (And more!)

[/list]

[h1]Planned Additions[/h1]
Currently, the mod is functioning in what can be considered a [i]final[/i] state (barring any patch/balance fixes). However, there are definitely future plans in mind!
[list]
[*]Add a chain of events which leads up to the acquisition of gunpowder.
[*]Add in additional unique/cultural gunpowder regiments.
[*]More localization for different languages.
[/list]
There's no set date on when these things will be introduced but I do hope to get these extras added in eventually!

[h1]Mod Compatibility[/h1]
There shouldn't be any conflicts with any mods not listed below, as the files are all unique.

[h3]Possible Conflicts[/h3]
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2238122607]Dieu et Mon Droit[/url] - There may be compatibility issues with DMD as it weighs/recruits MAA regiments using it's own unique balance system. [i](You may not see the same system applied to the Arquebusier type if used together)[/i]
[/list]

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[b]**YOU MAY NEED TO START A NEW SAVE**[/b]
In order for the innovations to appear properly you might need to start a new save, blame PDX for not making them seamlessly integrate. Sorry folks!!

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
[list]
[*]With running saves the innovations may not appear properly on the Cultural Innovations screen. (Please see the [b]section below[/b] for a possible fix)
[*]If you don't see the [b]Arquebus[/b] innovation or it's cultural counterparts [i][u]this is intended[/u][/i]. You must research the [b]Handgonne[/b] innovation [u][i]first[/i][/u] for the consecutive innovations to appear.
[/list]
[h3]Possible Solutions[/h3]
[i][u][This fix may or may not work][/u][/i]

A quick workaround to solve this issue, [b]with running saves[/b], is to open your game with the [b]debug_mode[/b] option enabled in the launcher and input the following command via console:

[b]"discover_innovation innovation_handgonne"[/b]

This will unlock the ability to recruit the MAA regiment for the Handgonner and unlock the consecutive innovations. The only drawback to doing this is you don't get the artificial time-lock if you force unlock it before the intended year.
