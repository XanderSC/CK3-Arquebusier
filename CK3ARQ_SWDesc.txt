[h1]Overview[/h1]
Adds the "Arquebus" to the game as a late medieval era tech [b]available to all cultures[/b]. 

The downside to this awesome firepower? It's locked behind a set date for semi-historical accuracy. You can find it under "Cultural and Regional" innovations.

The unit stats are pretty buffed for a ranged unit so if any changes are necessary they'll be made, for the sake of balance.

[h1]Mod Compatibility[/h1]
There shouldn't be any conflicts with mods at all as the files are all unique. 

As long as your modifications don't alter the localization strings for the triggers [b]"current_date/current_year"[/b], everything should appear as intended.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*]With running saves the innovation may not appear properly on the Cultural Innovations screen. (Please see [b]Troubleshooting[/b] for a possible fix)
[/list]

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[b]**YOU MAY NEED TO START A NEW SAVE**[/b]
In order for this innovation to appear properly you might need to start a new save, blame PDX for not making them seamlessly integrate. Sorry folks!!

[b]**POSSIBLE WORKAROUND**[/b]
A quick workaround to solve this issue, with running saves, is to open your game with the [b]debug_mode[/b] option enabled in the launcher and unlock the innovation via console with this command:
[b]"discover_innovation innovation_arquebus"[/b]

This will unlock the ability to recruit the MAA regiment for the Arquebusier. The only drawback to doing this is you don't get the artificial time-lock if you force unlock it before the intended year.

[b][i]*If I'm wrong, please leave a note in the comments! I haven't had the ability to source a lot of outside testing for this!*[/i][/b]
