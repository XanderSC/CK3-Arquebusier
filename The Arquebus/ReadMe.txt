# VERSION: "1.5" #

This modification was made for the simple purpose of introducing the late medieval era invention of the "Arquebus", which was first used in Europe and the Middle East by the Ottomans towards the middle part of the 15th century.

1. BASICS

	How to Acquire
		- The simplest way to acquire this innovation is to take any culture to the Late Medieval Era and wait for the year 1385 to arrive. (The innovation will not progress until then.)
		- Once acquired you can hire the special "Arquebusier" MAA in the Army Menu.
	
	The Arquebusier regiment is a highly boosted ranged unit which counters Spearmen and Heavy Infantry type regiments, it's also utilizing it's own custom regiment type. 
	It's natural counters are all cavalry type regiments, such as Camel Riders, Armored Cavalry, etc.
	
2. FUTURE PLANS
