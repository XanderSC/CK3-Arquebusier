# VERSION: "1.0a" #

This modification was made for the simple purpose of introducing the late medieval era invention of the "Arquebus", which was first used in Europe and the Middle East by the Ottomans towards the middle part of the 15th century.

1. BASICS

	How to Acquire
		- The simplest way to acquire this innovation is to take any culture to the Late Medieval Era and wait for the year 1385 to arrive. (The innovation will not progress until then.)
		- Once acquired you can hire the special "Arquebusier" MAA in the Army Menu.
	
	The Arquebusier unit is a highly boosted "archer" type unit, similar to the way the Crossbowman was introduced by PDX.
	
2. FUTURE PLANS
