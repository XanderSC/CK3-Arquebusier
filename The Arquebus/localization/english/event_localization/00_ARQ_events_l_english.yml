  ARQ_main.0003.desc:0 "You've decided that it would be better to start producing the [gunpowder|E] yourself.\n\nTo help you with this task you've also decided to employ the leading Alchemical experts so that you can retain this knowledge without giving too much away to neighboring realms.\n\n"My liege, I am your Chief Alchemist and I'm here to report that we're ready to begin the process of synthesizing gunpowder." They look at you and wait for your answer."

They believe they've finally nailed the right combination and they're ready to begin production.\n\n"My liege, how would you like us to acquire the necessary materials we'll need for producing this black powder?" Asks one of the Alchemists before waiting for your response."
  ARQ_main.0004.a:0 "Utilize Local Materials"

  ARQ_main.0005.t:0 "The Road of Silk"
  ARQ_main.0005.desc:0 "Instead of producing the mixture ourselves, you've decided it would be best to stockpile a large sum and save resources on production.\n\nTo accomplish this you've tasked your Master Trader with a larger trade mission this time, to head back to the Silk Road.\n\n"It's time for us to head off, My liege! We'll make sure to report back with any favorable trade deals." They wait for you to provide them with the necessary amount of gold so they can begin their journey."

  ARQ_main.0006.t:0 "Peculiar Arms Deal"
  ARQ_main.0006.desc:0 "Many years have passed since you sent your Trade Delegation to the Silk Road on a mission to acquire [gunpowder|E]. You've begun to worry that they've run off with your gold and are off somewhere laughing about this mysterious "black powder".\n\nHowever, one day you receive a letter indicating that your delegation has finally found a reputable source from a local dealer. They write in their letter that the cost is fair, but the locals may be open to bartering, and await your response."
  ARQ_main.0006.a:0 "Strike the Deal"
  ARQ_main.0006.a.flavor:0 "The locals here have offered us a large sum of gunpowder for a reasonable cost, perhaps we should accept?"
  ARQ_main.0006.b:0 "Barter with the Locals"
  ARQ_main.0006.b.flavor:0 "Your trader is positive he can establish better terms for our trade agreement, should we barter?"
  ARQ_main.0006.success:0 "Your Trader has succeeded in hagggling for a reduced price on the deal!"
  ARQ_main.0006.failure:0 "Your Trader has failed in his bartering, the deal was struck at the original price."

  ARQ_main.0007.t:0 "Catching Fire"
  ARQ_main.0007.desc:0 "The Council has sent your Chancellor to discuss some good news. They've arranged a meeting with you so they can perform a demonstration of their latest acquisition.\n\n"My liege, I come with good news and a spectacular display. We've acquired the [gunpowder|E] that has eluded us for some time! Our war engineers have already begun adapting this resource for use in a new weapon that they've called the Handgonne." They then retrieve a long pole like object and lead you outside to the courtyard. "With this we can change the course of history forever."\n\nYour Chancellor then lights the fuse at the end of the Handgonne and aims down range, firing off a loud bang that sends a lead projectile sailing through a suit of armor waiting at the end of the courtyard."
  ARQ_main.0007.a:0 "We have acquired Gunpowder!"
  ARQ_main.0007.a.flavor:0 "With the success of our project we have now acquired the means to procure gunpowder ourselves. Success!"

  ARQ_main.0011.desc:0 "It's been quite a few months now since you've tasked your Marshal with the Arquebus project. What could they possibly be doing that warrants no update to their liege?\n\nUpon arriving to the Armory you find your Marshal quite preoccupied managing an entirely chaotic workshop. They begin to complain to you about a lack of manpower, lack of funds to hire more servants for the work and even their day!\n\nYou almost immediately drown out the noise from your Marshal, far more concerned with how you can improve progress..."

Unlike the chaotic scene from the last time you ventured to the Armory, your Marshal seems to be doing surprisingly well. They even give you promising details about the project.\n\nYou realize you aren't needed but since you're already here... perhaps you can offer your assistance in some way?"
